(How to select through the elements)

1. `getElementById`

- Grabbing elements by their ids obviously.

```javascript
const grandparent = document.getElementById('grandparent-id');
```

2. `getElementsByClassName`

- Multiple elements with the same class.

```javascript
const parents = document.getElementsByClassName('parent');
```

3. `querySelector`



Actually now its not that difficult so I will just watch the vid.
