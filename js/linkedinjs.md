## Notes from Linkedin Learning's JS essentials training
I believe this course could be the only thing I need to cover all the basic features of JS. I can look for some sub topics I dont quite understand on Youtube later on. I need a structured course.

### Linting and formatting

- ESLint and Prettier for better linting and formatting.
- ESLint is like a spellcheck for JS which can help automatically detect coding errors and can do basic cleanup automatically.
- Both needs Node.js
- Install node and hit `npm install` inside the project folder for the dependencies.
- And setting:`formatonsave` should be checked, for prettier and ESLint to work on the files.
- They work flawlessly :). I m loving this course already.

### Browser Console
- `window.document` to see the page source of the page in the console.
- We can just type in whatever we want to know about(elements,tags,...) inside the console.
```javascript
thisVar //will show everything related to thisVar
```

### Basics

---
- We will have to learn JS backward in this course looks like. OOP first;DOM; and functions.
