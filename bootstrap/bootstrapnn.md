# Notes from Net Ninja's Bootstrap Playlist

I am really excited for this one

- css framework
- mobile-first and responsive websites
- includes pre-made components - navbars,buttons,modals,tabs,tooltips,accordions and more
- comes fully baked :) with a responsive, 12-column, CSS grid system for layouts.
- easy to customize :) 

> Installing Bootstrap

We can use `CDN` for now. Just copy the CSS and JS and put in their respective places.
- CSS:
```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">
```
- JS:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
