# Notes from Mosh's machine learning project included in his course on YT
*I dun know if my machine can handle this and looks like it cant lol*
### How it works
We build a model and give it a load of data to train it. The more data it receives, the more accurate it will work.

### ML steps
1. Import the data(*normally .csv files*)
2. Clean the data(*removing duplicates etc*)
3. Split the Data into Training/Test sets
4. Create a model
5. Train the model
6. Make Predictions
7. Evaluate and improve

We will use `Scikit learn` in this one to build a model with an algorithm.

## Libraries and Tools for ML

1. ### Numpy

- Provides a multi-dimensional array

2. ### Pandas

- Data analysis library which provides data frames(2D data structures like excel spreadsheet)

3. ### MatPlotLib

- Math library for creating plots
  
4. ### Scikit-learn

- Provides complex algorithm like decision trees, neural networks and so on.

### Tools
#### Jupyter Notebook
wont work on my poor laptop lol
