# Notes from Tech with Tim's Flask tutorial

I skipped the data structures and algorithms and OOP and jumped to this framework so I dont really know how it will go but I will learn those concepts later on anyway. I just want to build something up as quick as possible.

Anyway here I go.

- Will have to make a folder
  - (projects/flask/flaskwebsite)
  
- Directory set up now up for the action
- flask module installed in that particular directory(*maybe we need to install this module in every other direcotories we will work on?*)
- install flask-login
- install flask-sqlalchemy(for database)
  
```
pip install flask
pip install flask-login
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
```
- then go into *__int__.py* and set up the application

I think I will just do what he does and not write down already single thing here.
