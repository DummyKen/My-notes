# Notes from Mosh's Django Project
- Installed Django inside the project folder `PyShop`.
- Run the command `django-admin startproject Pyshop` to start a django project folder. Will create a folder with modules files.
- Run `python manage.py runserver` to manage our project and will start a development web server.
