# VSCode Crash Course Notes Part I
*At first I was thinking on just writing notes just in text file but turns out I hate writing notes in text files so nope. Copied the text file and put it into code snippet part.*

### Notes from VScode's Crash Course from Freecodecamp written in VScode :3 get it.

Attr: SC = Shortcut, 

2/11/21 Here we go

## SIDE BAR

### Search and Replace

- The search icon at the sidebar is used to search for key words inside the 'folder' or the files opened in the editor.
- And down that search icon is the 'replace' using which we can replace certain words with other words(VScode will show the preview pane )

### Source Control

- Also at the sidebar, the git control is used to see our git status files, which files are modified, untracked and other git stuff.

    ###Debugging>>>

-Debugging section to do degugging stuff which I haven't learnt yet

### Extensions

- Extensions bar ofc

- Wow we can open and edit files side by side just by dragging them to the side and resize. This could come in handy for real. Not only two either, we can do as much as our screen persists lol. This could come in handy when writing HTML, CSS and js side by side.

### Command palette(quite useful I guess)

`Ctrl+shift+P` can search and type shortcuts here(like a shortcuts master)

### Zen mode(wowww)
Command palette-->toggle zen mode-->nothing on screen but my code :O super duper cool. 
> Shortcut
`Ctrl+K Z` (not combined separated)
This is super cool and handy.(only one file tho)

### Minimap(topright corner)
We can use this one to scroll down or up the large files instead of scrolling all the way from the file itself. Another super handy stuff in CSS and other projects.
We can just make it invisible from palette as well to make the screen cleaner.

### Find and replace(Ctrl+F)
We can select some word and press the SC to find it and replace it or in any order.(SC first)
Quite handy.(This one is only in a file tho. For multiple files, use from sidebar)

### Close file(Ctrl+W)
- Switch between the opened files(`Ctrl+Tab`)(Ctrl+shift+tab for reverse order)

- Search and open file inside opened files and recently closed files `Ctrl+P`
(no need for sidebar)

- Go to a word or words. Instead of pressing the arrow keys over and over for many times, we can use `'Ctrl+arrow keys'` to jump from word to word instead of letter from letter. Super handy indeed.

- `Ctrl Home/End` to get to the top/bottom of the file.

- Copy paste the entire line - `Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V`

- And also Emmet abbr(super useful I know I used :3)
  - Emmets powers>
    - `div.class` --> div with class I used 
    - `div#id` --> div with id(this will also come in handy I believe)
    - `div.class#id` --> div with class and id as well(or div#.)
    (div is default when no element is specified)

- Generate multiple elements of same group(element*times)(WOOOO)
  - `p*4` --> 4 paragraphs
  - `li*3` --> 3 list elements(might not be super useful in other languages but be super useful in Web stuff)

- `input:type` --> generate text input(these snippets are so so cool that I should really learn them and remember them for sure.)

### CSS snippets
    - p10 --> padding: 10px;
    - m10 --> margin: 10px; and stuff, will be finding out more when working I guess

## Settings(Ctrl+',')

Cursor animation(blink/block) and cursor text decoration(underline,line,block) are really cool. I should really test these out.
