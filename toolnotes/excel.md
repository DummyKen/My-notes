### Project 1: *Payroll*

- Adding data to spreadsheet is the same just as I remembered.
- We can add *'$'* currency sign by just clicking the $ button in number tab.

#### Formulas

Just use a '=' sign at the start and write the formula.
- Example: if we want to write a formula that multiplies the values inside Cell A3 and Cell B5
  - start with '='
  - select the cell A3
  - type *
  - select cell B5
  - and enter
  - Boom
- We can spread the cells that use the same formula by draggin from the top cell's bottom-right corner.
- If we double-click on the cell containing a formula, we can see the formula and related cells.
