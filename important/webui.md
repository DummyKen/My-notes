# Notes from Coursera's Front-end Web UI frameworks: Bootstrap 4(From Hong Kong university)

>Course Outline:
- Bootstrap
  - Responsive Design and Bootstrap Grid System
  - Bootstrap CSS and JS components
- Web Tools:    
  - Git
  - Node.js, NPM
  - Grunt and Gulp

This course, I believe, is much more than Bootstrap. This course could be completed in four weeks time fuck yeah I will. This course is superiorly well organized than most courses I took here.
